                "As has been told in the History of Currency section, currency has existed in some form or another for as long as humans have been around – through bartering to coins to cash. Physical cash and money are becoming quite obsolete and you may be asking yourself, why?",
                "The growth of technology has led to many advances! Making purchases via card or electronic transfer are much more convenient and save time. Even more time can be saved as all transactions move towards biometric payments – time can be saved by not having to swipe your card, enter your PIN etc. All the security you need will be held within yourself alone. How many times have you lost money and just can’t find it?",
                "That problem just doesn’t exist with biometric payments, as you’ll always have yourself when making a purchase. With the rise of credit cards, contactless payments and crpytocurrencies like Bitcoin, the need for cash is becoming obsolete.  There are quite a few factors in making the progress away from cash quite difficult. The human race are attached to cash as it’s been around for so long and it is universally used by lots of vendors and users. The restrictions that are also in place for the youth having bank accounts also play a part in people being attached to cash. It can be seen that the progress away from cash more of a slog than a sprint."

                "Blockchain is a new way of storing information. It uses multiple servers to store the same information so that if one is attacked the data is not lost.",
				"Put it like this, a just sounds like a kind of database with built-in validation—which it is. ",
				"However, the clever bit is that the data is not stored in a one individual location or managed by any single person. Instead, it is said to be distributed, existing on several computers at the same time in such a way that anybody with an interest can maintain a copy. ",
				"Better still, the block validation system ensures that nobody can change the records. Rather, old transactions are preserved forever and new transactions are added to the data irreversibly.",
				"Effectively a blockchain is a kind of independent, transparent, and permanent database coexisting in multiple locations and shared by a community. Therefore, it’s sometimes referred to as a mutual distributed ledger (MDL). ",
				"Blockchains are incredibly secure against attacks, as a potential attacker would have to attack all the servers at once, rather than attacking one and everything going down. There could be thousands of different machines, and all would have to be attacked!",
				"This would require tons upon tons of power to attack, and that is simply too impractical.", 
				"There’s nothing new about MDLs, their origins traceable to 1976. But for a long time, they were regarded as complicated and not altogether safe.",
				"But if the registry was not owned by a central third party but sitting on multiple machines and everybody had copies, it would have resilience and looking up transactions would be quick. With the data being immutable once entered in the ledger, it would provide a permanent record that financial regulators and auditors could quickly fall in love with.",
				"In other words, it’s a souped-up audit trail for anything you like, not just a cryptocurrency. It’s not just one system. Indeed, the situation can be compared of the database revolution of the 1970s: there wasn’t just one type or structure for a database, you created the specific database you wanted for your own purposes."

Perhaps, standardization could solve this problem. The use of  biometrics data is currently largely unregulated. Once governments have set standards, different companies will not be able to operate under different degrees of scrutiny providing better security and more safety for users.",

A fraud can currently apply for a credit card using a fake I.D.  however it would be difficult for a fraud to apply using a fake fingerprint. Card trapping is a regular occurrence at local ATMs. A card can be physically trapped in the machine comprising the details of the user/card owner – frauds go on to create counterfeit cards.
